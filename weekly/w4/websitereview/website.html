<h1>Geek Culture Website Review</h1>

<h2>estarland.com</h2>
<p>This is the main website for a popular video game store in Chantilly.  The homepage clearly gives off a vibe of geek culture, informing the</p>
<p>user about new releases and other deals they have to offer.  It's not too flashy and has enough detail to make it not seem too basic.</p>

<h2>GameStop</h2>
<p>Similarly to eStarLand's website, the homepage is easy and simple to understand and navigate while also informing the viewer of any new</p>
<p>releases.  This also includes new deals, a staple in most online video game marketplaces.</p>

<h2>Metacritic</h2>
<p>A rather basic design which still gets the job done, Metacritic has an excellent search system for multiple video games, shows and</p>
<p>movies that have been reviewed over the years.  Everything you need to use to search is conveniently placed on the top of the screen,</p>
<p>above more news about the latest ratings the website's top reviewers have posted.</p>

<h2>NintendoLife</h2>
<p>This news site focused solely on Nintendo products has a Nintendo feel to it, with its red and black borders and Mario patterned background.</p>
<p>While this site isn't owned by Nintendo per se, it still shows that this website is dedicated to help spread the news about whatever Nintendo</p>
<p>has planned soon.</p>

<h2>Katsucon</h2>
<p>Everything needed to look up info or get registered for this Japanese convention is all placed together on the top of the homepage, neatly</p>
<p>organized above a scrolling slideshow of other exhibits and activities the convention has to offer.</p>
